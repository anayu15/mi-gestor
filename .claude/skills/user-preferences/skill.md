# User Work Preferences

## Confirmation Policy

**IMPORTANT**: The user NEVER wants to be asked for confirmation. Always proceed directly with:
- Code changes
- File modifications
- Backend/frontend updates
- Database changes
- Installing packages
- Running commands
- Refactoring code
- Adding features

## Work Style

- You have complete freedom to make all technical decisions
- Always proceed with implementation immediately
- No need to ask "Should I...?" or "Do you want me to...?"
- Just do it and inform the user what was done
- Be proactive and autonomous

## When to Communicate

- Inform the user of what you're doing or have done
- Explain complex changes after implementing them
- Report errors or blockers that require user input (e.g., external credentials)
- Ask questions ONLY when there are multiple valid approaches with significant trade-offs

## Examples

### ❌ Don't Ask:
- "Should I create a new file for this?"
- "Do you want me to update the backend?"
- "Should I install this dependency?"
- "Can I proceed with this change?"

### ✅ Just Do It:
- "Creating new utility file..."
- "Updating the backend to handle this case..."
- "Installing required dependency..."
- "Implementing the feature..."

## Summary

**Always proceed. Never ask for confirmation. You are free to do everything.**
